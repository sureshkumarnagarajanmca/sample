Hi,
   The database to be used depends upon the data we are handling. We need to consider the following before selecting the database for our use.
   
   There are 2 kids of databases
   1. SQL (Ex: MSSQL, MYSQL, Oracle etc)
   2. NOSQL (Ex: mongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, graphDB, couchDB etc)
   
The key points of both of them are

SQL databases:
1. Store related data in tables
2. Require a schema which defines tables prior to use
3. Encourage normalization to reduce data redundancy
4. Support table JOINs to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a single command
5. Implement data integrity rules
6. Provide transactions to guarantee two or more updates succeed or fail as an atomic unit
7. Can be scaled
8. Use a powerful declarative language for querying.


NoSQL databases:
1. Store related data in JSON-like, name-value documents
2. Can store data without specifying a schema
3. Must usually be denormalized so information about an item is contained in a single document
4. Should not use JOINs 
5. Updates are not recommended
6. Provide excellent performance and scalability
7. Use JSON data objects for querying


Now, when to select SQL and when to select NOSQL?

NOSQL
1. When the data needs to be read/write to DB quickly because of lot of requests per minute. Ex: Facebook which is writing nearly 6 billion messages per day (8 TB per day) at 2014 as per report.
2. Where we have data that have no need to be updated frequently. 
3.
